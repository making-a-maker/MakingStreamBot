1) RENAME AND REORGANIZE THIS BULLSHIT

Fix the module thing - change it back to just a script

automated install
 - python3
 - git
 - vim?
 - auto-git bot program
 - make log folder
 - pip
 - pyyaml
 - neopixel / RPi libraries
 - set up to auto run on boot

investigate the need for sudo to run bot program
 - why? can I get rid of it?

setup script - copy example config files (config.yaml.example -> config.yaml)
 - then add config.yaml to the .gitignore (preseve local configs)

move colors into plain text table (yaml file?)

rotating log files (keep sizes down)
re-evaluate what is logged, and where




Future-things
alternate command routes (phone, IFTTT)
Alert response from events on Twitch

message queue
 - separate the chat bot into one program, leds in another program
   - chat bot publishes the commands / messages
   - led program listens
command queue - minimum time between commands (prevent spam)

Safety Mode - disable the color shifting - mod command (Banzai Baby-esque)

Alarm Clocks - time based LED things (for polerin's meeting)

change intensity by command
Other animations - gradients, switch between colors, patterns, linear-interpolation
user defined routines - color to color, time frames, shifts

Watch chat for game messages - success and failure messages (which could then trigger sounds)

An image that is flash-able
Or a single package for Raspbian
