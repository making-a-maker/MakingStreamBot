TODO LIST:
√ Text responses
√ Command Queue for leds
commands that start the line (!red and other words)
status indicators - connected to IRC, ready - flash or indicate states

bust it all apart (refactor into separate things)




1) RENAME AND REORGANIZE THIS BULLSHIT

Fix the module thing - change it back to just a script

automated install
 - python3
 - git
 - vim?
 - auto-git bot program
 - make log folder
 - pip
 - pyyaml
 - neopixel / RPi libraries
 - set up to auto run on boot

investigate the need for sudo to run bot program
 - why? can I get rid of it?

setup script - copy example config files (config.yaml.example -> config.yaml)
 - then add config.yaml to the .gitignore (preseve local configs)

move colors into plain text table (yaml file?)

rotating log files (keep sizes down)
re-evaluate what is logged, and where




Future-things
alternate command routes (phone, IFTTT)
Alert response from events on Twitch

message queue
 - separate the chat bot into one program, leds in another program
   - chat bot publishes the commands / messages
   - led program listens
command queue - minimum time between commands (prevent spam)

Safety Mode - disable the color shifting - mod command (Banzai Baby-esque)

Alarm Clocks - time based LED things (for polerin's meeting)

change intensity by command
Other animations - gradients, switch between colors, patterns, linear-interpolation
user defined routines - color to color, time frames, shifts

Watch chat for game messages - success and failure messages (which could then trigger sounds)

An image that is flash-able
Or a single package for Raspbian




Raspbian Buster lite

For security reasons, ssh is no longer enabled by default. 
To enable it you need to place an empty file named ssh (no extension) in the root of the boot disk.
/boot/ssh


/boot/wpa_supplicant.conf
Then paste the following into it (adjusting for your ISO 3166 alpha-2 country code, network name and network password):

country=US
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1

network={
    ssid="NETWORK-NAME"
    psk="NETWORK-PASSWORD"
}

default hostname:  raspberrypi
default user: pi
default password: raspberry 

sudo raspi-config
change password

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade

sudo apt install python3 python3-pip git vim
sudo pip3 install pyyaml

git clone https://github.com/making-a-maker/MakingBot.git

cd MakingBot

./setup.sh

get oauth key from twitch, replace values in private_config.yaml


#########################################################
Potential next steps:

automated installation
2) led animations (multiple stages)
break it up into multiple programs (long)
1) text response in chat (colors)
hex color handling
pantone color handling
